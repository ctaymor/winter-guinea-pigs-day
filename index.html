          <h3 class="h3">You might wonder what Winter Guinea Pig's Day is</h3>
        <p>
  In an interfaith Jewish family, December can be emotionally fraught. The idea of Winter Guinea Pig's Day was born as a purely secular festival in January onto which we could stick precious family traditions (twinkle lights, candles, eggnog, breaking bread with loved ones on cold-ish winter nights) without the complications of religious holidays. It's evolved from there...</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Traditions</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">Naming</h3>
        <p>Why is it called erev Winter Guinea Pig's Day?
  As you may know, Justin and Caroline are a tad weird, with overactive imaginations. (You know about our cat W.B. Roosevelt, Esquire who is both a lawyer and an author, right?) Guinea pigs are our ... sort of mascot. Our joke is that we are the king and queen of the guinea pigs. Thus, of course the festival we celebrate in winter should be the winter festival of the guinea pigs. We celebrate with a big party the night of Winter Guinea Pig's day (which is the night before), so it's erev (a hebrew word which means the evening before, which is considered the beginning of the day. The eve of Winter Guinea Pig's Day).</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Real Guinea Pigs or Mythical</h3>
        <p>Are there real guinea pigs at your house on Winter Guinea Pig's Day?
  No. It would be very stressful for a guinea pig to be around the cat.</p>
          <h3 class="h3">Celebrations</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, there is a larger party with friends and family on erev Winter Guinea Pig's Day. The celebrations start shortly after sundown, and often go into the wee hours, with people stopping by for an hour here or there, or staying all evening.</p>
        <p>Winter Guinea Pig's Day celebrations during the day are lower key. It's a day for relaxing with loved ones. Small gifts are sometimes exchanged in the family unit.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Time</h3>
        <p>The Guinea Pig day, like the Jewish day, begins at sundown. The evening of the festi
        val, as it begins, is called erev Winter Guinea Pig's Day, from the Hebrew for `evening`.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">Date Calculation</h3>
        <p>How is the date of Winter Guinea Pig's Day determined?
  The guinea pigs follow an agricultural-solar hybrid calendar. The date is usually the second Saturday night and Sunday day after the winter solstice, which happens to usually fall on the first weekend in January by the Gregorian calendar. However, due to the occaisional leap year, the festival sometimes occurs later in January. For the astute, this does indeed mean that in the Southern Hemisphere, the festival is celebrated in early July.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Citrus Trees</h3>
        <p>On the eve of the festival, one shall bring into one's main living quarters a live citrus tree, to be placed in a central location. It should remain there throughout the festival (and possibly until the danger of frost as passed, depending on your climate and sunlight). In Florida and Los Angeles, the local custom is to use an orange tree. However, in the Bay Area, a meyer lemon is considered most proper.</p>
         <h3 class="h3">Food</h3>
        <p>As guinea pigs are herbivores, the traditional foods are vegetarian, especially in the evening celebration. Omnivores celebrating the festival might add meat to the daytime celebrations if it makes it more festive for them.</p>
        <p>There are significant regional variations in food traditions. However, spiced carrot pickles and hummus are two foods which are frequent across regions.</p>
        <p>Eggnog is often served, but usually only during the day. During the evening, sparkling drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic are traditional.</p>
